This project involves creating an animated space scene with a floating astronaut and a space jellyfish, implementing real-time animation synchronization. The space jellyfish model consists of a body with two scaled spheres and three tentacles, each formed from five ellipsoids. While I implemented the wave function for tentacle animation, I encountered some issues with the ellipsoids being separated when the amplitude was changed. Despite these challenges, I managed to animate the tentacles and positioned them around the jellyfish, although I noticed they could have been better centered. The jellyfish floats in a circle around the astronaut, maintaining alignment with the tangent of the circle. The astronaut model includes a helmet, visor, limbs (arms and legs), and other body features. For animation, the astronaut oscillates in both the x and y directions, and the legs and arms rotate at the hips and knees. I also animated the stars in the background, ensuring they are randomly positioned and move offscreen, with their positions reset once they move out of view. While the final scene is similar to the reference, some minor discrepancies exist, such as the jellyfish head's x-axis rotation. The scene fits within the required 512x512 window.
